Title: **LED controlled by Switch with LP-MSPM0G3507 MCU**

Objective:

To ensure one of the Launch LEDs turns on when the push button is pressed and turns off when the push button is not pressed (default state) using the **LP-MSPM0G3507 microcontroller**.


## Pseudocode for blinkLED-MSPM0G3507

### Steps:

**Step 1**: Initialise one of the Launch LEDs to be output (over here I have chosen LED2 to be our test LED.\
**Step 2**: Choose one of the Switches (I have chosen Switch 3 PB21) and set it to be a pull-up switch.\
**Step 3**: Check the value of Switch 3 continuously, if not pressed, stay in the same loop.\
**Step 4**: If Switch 3 is pressed, then turn ON the LED port.
